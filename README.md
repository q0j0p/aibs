# Analysis of neuronal cell types -WIP

## Broad objectives
- EDA of cell type data
- Characterize cell type morphology
- Classify cell types using ML, isolate important features
- Simulate the development of cell types using random walk growth (a "generative model" of neuronal cell types)



## Data collection and management
Data were collected using Allen Institute's SDK or 'scraped' from the website and stored in MongoDB database.  

### Neuromorpho data:
- 17817 neurons (mouse) from 217 labs
- 2720 neurons (human) from 15 labs


### Data sources
- [Allen Institute cell types api](http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/cell_types.html)
- [neuromorpho.org](http://neuromorpho.org/byspecies.jsp)
